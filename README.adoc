### Arduino Audio Library for Arduino SAMD21

This polyphonic library allows you to play WAV files from SPI Flash and SD card. Plays up to ~4 WAV files simultaneously. Medium quality output 8bit and up to 44.1khz if using QUAD SPI flash on the Adafruit M0 boards.

This library plays WAV files stored on the SPI Flash Adafruit includes on their Express boards. This includes:
*Itsybits M0 Express (tested)
*Trinket M0 Express (have board will test)
*ItsyBitsy M4 Express
*Feather M0 Express

Read this great description in the Adafruit tutorial for getting the WAV files onto your Adafruit M0 Express board
