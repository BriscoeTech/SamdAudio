### Audio Library for Arduino SAMD21

The SamdAudio library enables an Arduino SAMD21 board to play back 8bit .wav files 
from a storage device like an SD card, without blocking program execution.

This library is based off of ALoyseTech original SamdAudio, but has some minor functionality improvements.

Library allows the user to setup upto four channels of sound, allowing for up to four sounds to be played simultaneously! 

This library has also been verified to work with FreeRtos https://github.com/BriscoeTech/Arduino-FreeRTOS-SAMD21
